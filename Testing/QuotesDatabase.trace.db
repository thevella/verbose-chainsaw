It's tempting to think that if it's hard, then it's valuable.
Most valuable things are hard.
Most hard things are completely useless - (picture of someone smashing
their head through concrete blocks kung-fu style).
Hard DOES NOT EQUATE TO BEING valuable.
Remember Friendster back in the day?
You'd sign in, invite friends, have 25 friends, go to their profile, and
then it'd show how you were connected to each one.
That's an impressive [some geeky CS jargon] Cone traversal of a tree -
100 million string comparisons per page - it won't scale.
Used to take a minute per page to load, and Friendster died a painful
death.

They didn[*]'t solve the hard problem. But they make the more relevant
assumption that you want to be connected to hot women. [LOL]

quickly bypassed Friendster and never looked back.

lately, and it seems like all you do is brag about code you wrote in the
past, and people start looking at you funny while you're shooting your
mouth off, realize it's because they know. They might not even know they

all means, throw yourself a nice big party, buy yourself a nice car,
soak up the adulation of an adoring crowd. Then shut the fuck up and get
back to work.

I think it is wise, and only honest, to warn you that my goal is
immodest. It is not my purpose to "transfer knowledge" to you that,
subsequently, you can forget again. My purpose is no less than to
effectuate in each of you a noticeable, irreversable change. I want you
to gain, for the rest of your lives, the insight that beautiful proofs
are not "found" by trial anf error but are the result of a consciously
applied design discipline. I want you to raise your quality standards. I
mean, if 10 years from now, when you are doing something quick and
dirty, you suddenly visualize that I am looking over your shoulders and
say to yourself "Dijkstra would not have liked this", well, that would
be enough immortality for me.

Remember Friendster back in the day?

They didn[*]'t solve the hard problem. But they make the more relevant

While I’ve always appreciated beautiful code, I share Jonathan’s concern
about studying it too much. I think studying beauty in music and
painting has led us to modern classical music and painting that the
majority of us just don’t get. Beauty can be seen when it emerges, but
isn’t something to strive for in isolation of a larger context. In the
software world, the larger context would be the utility of the software
to the end user.

a ruling class, a "superior" race, by society, the state, or a leader.
They are held in place by none other than yourself. Those who seek to
exploit are not themselves free, for they place no value in freedom. Who
is it that really employs you and commands you to pick up your daily
load? And who is it that you allow to pass judgment on the adequacy of
your toil? Who have you empowered to dangle the carrot before you and
threaten with disapproval? Who, when you wake each morning, sends you
off to what you call your work?
Is there an "I want to" behind all your "I have to," or have you been so
long forgotten to yourself that "I want" exists only as an idea in your
head? If you have disconnected from your soul's desire and are drowning
in an ocean of "have to," then rise up and overthrow your master. Begin
the journey toward emancipation.  Work only in such a way that you are
truly self-employed.

Remember Friendster back in the day?
You'd sign in, invite friends, have 25 friends, go to their profile, and
then it'd show how you were connected to each one.
That's an impressive [some geeky CS jargon] Cone traversal of a tree -
100 million string comparisons per page - it won't scale.
Used to take a minute per page to load, and Friendster died a painful
death.

MySpace - not interested in solving problems
They use the shortcut of "Miss Fitzpatrick is in your extended network"
(i.e. even when you're not even signed up for MySpace)
They didn't solve the hard problem. But they make the more relevant
assumption that you want to be connected to hot women. [LOL]
Shows Alexa graph showing that in early 2005 Myspace took off, and
quickly bypassed Friendster and never looked back.

100 million string comparisons per page - it won't scale.

MySpace - not interested in solving problems
They use the shortcut of ""Miss Fitzpatrick is in your extended network""

They didn't solve the hard problem. But they make the more relevant
assumption that you want to be connected to hot women. [LOL]

They didn't solve the hard problem. But they make the more relevant

Running fast requires conditioning your body, absorbing proper mechanics to
the point where they're second nature, and then forgetting the details and
letting it rip. It may sound funny to someone who hasn't been there, but
the more you can let go, the faster you can go.
Look at films of Mohammad Ali in his prime and you'll see how he had that
little wrist flick on the end of his jab; if he had to think about doing
that, he couldn't have done it. People have things inside them they don't
know about until it comes out. When somebody asks me how fast a human being
can run, I tell them that however fast they think it is, it'll be faster.

Something Confusing about "Hard":
It's tempting to think that if it's hard, then it's valuable.
Most valuable things are hard.
Most hard things are completely useless - (picture of someone smashing
their head through concrete blocks kung-fu style).
Hard DOES NOT EQUATE TO BEING valuable.
Remember Friendster back in the day?
You'd sign in, invite friends, have 25 friends, go to their profile, and
then it'd show how you were connected to each one.
That's an impressive [some geeky CS jargon] Cone traversal of a tree -
100 million string comparisons per page - it won't scale.
Used to take a minute per page to load, and Friendster died a painful
death.

MySpace - not interested in solving problems
They use the shortcut of "Miss Fitzpatrick is in your extended network"

It's tempting to think that if it's hard, then it's valuable.
Most valuable things are hard.
Most hard things are completely useless - (picture of someone smashing
their head through concrete blocks kung-fu style).
Hard DOES NOT EQUATE TO BEING valuable.
Remember Friendster back in the day?
You'd sign in, invite friends, have 25 friends, go to their profile, and
then it'd show how you were connected to each one.
That's an impressive [some geeky CS jargon] Cone traversal of a tree -
100 million string comparisons per page - it won't scale.
Used to take a minute per page to load, and Friendster died a painful
death.

MySpace - not interested in solving problems
They use the shortcut of "Miss Fitzpatrick is in your extended network"
(i.e. even when you're not even signed up for MySpace)
They didn't solve the hard problem. But they make the more relevant
assumption that you want to be connected to hot women. [LOL]
Shows Alexa graph showing that in early 2005 Myspace took off, and
quickly bypassed Friendster and never looked back.

Look at films of Mohammad Ali in his prime and you'll see how he had that
little wrist flick on the end of his jab; if he had to think about doing
that, he couldn't have done it. People have things inside them they don't
know about until it comes out. When somebody asks me how fast a human being
can run, I tell them that however fast they think it is, it'll be faster.

Code is that the only effective way to understand what people truly mean

intentionally lie or misrepresent themselves. What it means is that,
when asked direct questions about their interests and preferences,
people tend to give answers they believe the questioner wants to hear.

respond to these questions with their cortexes, the parts of their
brains that control intelligence rather than emotion or instinct. They
ponder a question, they process a question, and when they deliver an
answer, it is the product of deliberation. They believe they are telling
the truth. A lie detector would confirm this. In most cases, however,
